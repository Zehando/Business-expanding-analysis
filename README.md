Analysis of Eniac's Brazilian Market Expansion Strategy: Leveraging SQL and Business Context to Evaluate a Potential Partnership.
# Eniac's Brazilian Market Expansion Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the potential expansion of Eniac, a European online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, into the Brazilian market. Faced with the challenge of entering a new market quickly while maintaining its customer-centric approach, Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service (SaaS) company offering order management and after-sales services.

The core of this analysis revolves around evaluating two key concerns raised within Eniac regarding this potential partnership:

1.  **Product Compatibility:** Assessing whether Magist is a suitable partner for Eniac's high-end tech product catalog.
2.  **Delivery Efficiency:** Evaluating the speed and potential impact on customer satisfaction of deliveries facilitated through Magist's agreement with the Brazilian Post Office.

This project utilizes a snapshot of Magist's database (analyzed via SQL) and a presentation (provided in PDF format) to address these concerns and provide insights into the feasibility of the partnership.
